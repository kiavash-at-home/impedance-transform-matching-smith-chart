In 2011, I tried to port this project from Borland TurboC++ to GCC using one of libraries that re-implemented BGI. Some porting steps were included in the comment section of the code. The rest, I tried to put comments in the [commit b1cac7c79be1cbd9f943068475066d5217e7818d](https://github.com/kiavash-at-home/impedance-transform-matching-smith-chart/commit/b1cac7c79be1cbd9f943068475066d5217e7818d).

To make this code, you will need:

* ~~Find yourself one of the BGI implementations~~
  * ~~For example, Download and install [SDL_bgi](http://libxbgi.sourceforge.net/#download)~~
* Clone this repo locally and `<make>` it.

The section of the code that I added to port it to GCC is released under Apache 2.0.

There is not much documention in the original project, however the GUI is designed intuitively.
